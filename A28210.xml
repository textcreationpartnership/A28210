         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I do not remember that I was ever more aſtoniſh'd at the prodigiouſneſs of any ſpectacle, to ſee what perdition was threatned to the poor men, and they ſo to eſcape it. About four hours after, the violence of water being paſt, <hi>Fiſher</hi> one other of the <hi>Miners</hi> went in, with more curioſity than wit, to ſee what effect it had wrought there: and being ſome ſixty fathome in, creeping very low, his candle enkindled a vapour, which came on him with three or four flaſhes, and he ſuddainly returning, had his hair burnt off, and his clothes ſcorched, in which concluſion it gave a crack like the report of a Piece, and in a fierce guſt of wind blew out the Candles of three more coming after him.

               <p>I know it would be a motive of very feeble operation, to tell you how Princes and States have raiſed their Crowns, by deſcending into ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſſes as theſe; with ſome of whom wanton Antiquity hath been pleaſed to ſport her ſelf, and to play upon the ſimplicity of many, as <hi>Midas, Giges,</hi> the <hi>Argonauts, Croeſus,</hi> with the States of <hi>Athens,</hi> over whoſe Minerals was that renowned <hi>Thucydides</hi> a <hi>Praefect,</hi> as you are here.

               <p>But, dear Brethren, Friends, and Companions in Bonds, to aſſure you that I commiſerate your deplorable condition more than mine own, I would preſent you with a more ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Cordial than that of ſociety in your miſeries, which I have humbly petitioned the Honourable Parliament for, and hope I ſhall obtain to your temporal and eternal advantage. You are therefore firſt to underſtand, that when our Engliſh <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> Natures beſt modern Secretary, that excellent Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher the Lord Chancellour <hi>BACON,</hi> my ever-ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Maſter, had compleated his now extant Natural Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of Philoſophical Experiments, he then modell'd his <hi>Solomons Houſe</hi> in his <hi>New Atlantis</hi> thereto annexed, in which Academy they might be practiſed, <hi>But not by thoſe common wayes</hi> (as he was uſed to ſay) <hi>where even Fools might raiſe a</hi> Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramis, Coloſſus, or Mauſoleum <hi>to their ridiculous memories,</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:42606:19"/> Viz. <hi>from the Exchequers of bounteous and magnificent Princes, Piratick depredations, or Monopolous exactions from an opulent people; but rather by a Philoſophical Elixar and Chymical extraction, ſo quaint and admirable, that it ſeems to convince the Maxim,</hi> Out of nothing is made nothing. For he propoſed no other means to erect and maintain that ſtupendious Fabrick and the <hi>Magi</hi> thereof, who were by him deſigned thereto by his Theory, than the recovery of the Loſt by the help of the Dead. Reſolve the Riddle, and find your Cordial; for though it be truly Magical, 'tis not Necromantick.</p>
               <p>But not to delay you, I (as your <hi>Oedipus</hi>) thus open it: The <hi>Lost,</hi> are drowned and deſperately deſerted Mineral Works; the <hi>Dead,</hi> convicted and attainted perſons, who are indeed ſo in Law; and what is loſt, is not in nature as to the uſe and propriety of mankind. Cheer up my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, I have opened my dark lantern to you, and light is comfortable to the benighted. Now know, that that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Lord affecting my homebred ſimplicity, and being am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to raiſe a Younger brothers fortunes by ſuch Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, inſtituted me as his much-favored Pupil in his myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Philoſophical way of recovering and ſearching Mines, by mollifying their hardeſt Rocks, undermining their Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſeparating their Metals, and carrying Air through the loweſt levels of Hills or Mountains, without the vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of former charge to ſink Shafts for Air every twenty Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom. But he ſuddenly falling from an eminent height, as I by that time had deviated from his grave directions in the ſecure Paths of Vertue, impoſed on me a new task, <hi>Which was, not to ſearch the Rocky boſoms of the barren Mountains, but, by a timely retirement to ſome ſolitary place where I might ſeclude my ſelf from the treacherous vanities of the tumultuous world, to explore the deceitful Meanders of my ſtony Heart, and when Divine grace ſhould have aſsiſted my better Reaſon in overcoming the rebellious affections of my Senſual appetite, if then the like Providence ſhould call me thence to a more active life in the proſecution of his Mineral documents, I ſhould without any regret of my former penance attend the good hand of God in that deſign with humble patience; aſſuredly believing, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42606:19"/> ſince he had ſupported me in the conqueſt of my ſelf, he would conduct me through all difficulties, to the accompliſhing ſo great a work for my Countryes good, and his own glory.</hi> And according to his counſel and prediction, after I had lived three years as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſe in a deſolate Iſland in the Iriſh Seas, only converſing with God in my repentant tears, prayers and contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he miraculouſly called me thence to an unexpected for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, brought me into favor with my Prince, who granted me a Patent for all the Mines Royal, in order to my Lords Propoſals, and a Branch of his Royal Mint to coin ſuch Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as I ſhould extract from all Lead of my own finding; which was not a little, witneſſe the many great ſervices I did for that King therewith, notwithſtanding my great loſſes in the late Wars. But as the Times, ſo we in them are chang'd.</p>
               <p>Now here to prevent any that may ask, Why ſince by my Articles of War I am to be reſtored to all my former rights, I ſeek no more from the preſent State, than an aſſurance of the deſerted Mines of our Territories? I anſwer, That they will be enough, which is better than more: that then I was no way obnoxious to that government, but in my Soveraigns favor, and he in Peace, now theſe States look upon me as a pardoned and reconciled Enemy, and their vaſt expence in the Republick ſervice, permits Delinquents no ſuch allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, therefore I modeſtly ask the crumbs which they ſcorn to gather up, and therewith doubt not to perform my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, to the honor of my Country, and my Maſters memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But me thinks I hear our proud firſt Enemy (that envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirit of deluſion) whiſper to ſome of you, What will your condition of ſlavery be better here in your native Mines, than in a Forein Plantation, where your friends cannot ſee your ſufferings, nor you their proſperities, to their or your afflictions, becauſe they cannot mitigate yours, nor you participate of theirs, which will be no ſmall abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to your ſhames, and their ſorrows? To this I reply, <hi>That as the innocence of the ſufferer, not the rigor of the torment makes one a Martyr, ſo the cauſe of ſhame is in the act of the Crime, not in the nature of the Servitude; whereſoever to be ſuffered;</hi> your
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42606:20"/> guilt is known, and accompanies you every where; is it not then better here to expiate it where a ſafer and eaſier means is offered, if you intend to lead a new life? Conſider the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſſe and dangers of your tranſportations, through Storms, Enemies, and a ſparing ſalt diet: If you Land ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 'tis but to be ſold like Beaſts, and moſt likely to men of barbarous ſouls, through whoſe cruelty you ſhall gaſp out your dolorous lives with exceſſive labors, and when Hunger ſhall call for natures recruits, be forced to think the worſt imployed horſes of your own Country happier than your ſelves in their natural food; and after all this, if you can outlive your bondage in inriching your taskmaſters, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> for revenge or avarice may ſurprize your completed Plantations, and carry you away to conſume the ſad rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of your miſerable days in his Mines, without merit, expiation or hope: but thus you cannot ſuffer at home, where you may turn your neceſſities into vertues by a patient and humble ſubmiſſion to Gods will, for all evil of puniſhment is from him. I propoſe not this to you as Mineral Pioneers out of any deſign of advantage to my ſelf, your food, clothes, and materials, will coſt me as much as the hired expert Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; my plot upon you is the only ſalvation of your ſouls, and reſtitution of your liberties, through your contrition and penance, by Chriſts merits and Gods mercy, with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral rewards of benefit, and expiation, by your induſtrious diſcoveries in your allotted portions; which that you may obtain, ſacrifiſe but your ſins on the broken altars of your contrite hearts to the Lord of mercies, and you have his own words for your free pardons. O how will your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and deliverance make your friends and the Angels of Heaven to rejoyce! for I verily believe, the true compuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your hearts will more facilitate the penetration of our Rocky Addits than the ſtrokes of your hands: And to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and aſiſt you therein, I ſhall provide ſuch holy and Orthodox Inſtructors for you, that by your conſcientious obſervance of their moral and divine Lectures as well as their examples, you ſhall with much alacrity be able to overcome

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſult with your Conſciences, and they will doubtleſſe dictate to your memories, that the beſt way to pilot your ſad ſouls, bodies, lives, and reputations from tempeſtuous ſtorms of worldly vanities into a ſafe harbor, is with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hearts to take this Mineral calling upon you, and to think, ſpeak, and deport your ſelves towards God in it, as if all the world did behold you, and to live and converſe with man as in the immediate ſight of our divine Creator, and then we ſhall rejoyce in enjoying one another; for as I deſire the Almighty, not to forgive me my ſins, nor receive my ſoul, if I have any other ends than what hath been expreſt, ſo I deſire none of you to remove your ſelves to this harmleſſe and laborious calling, unleſs your reſolutions be firm to thoſe ends, which may crown your induſtry, otherwiſe we muſt be forc'd in obedience to our truſt, to return you bak to the Judge of your firſt condemnation, and pray that the All-Diſpoſer may call you by ſome other means to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which ſhall be the conſtant and fervent Petition of</p>

My honourable Maſter the late Lord Chancellor <hi>Bacon</hi> was wont
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42606:21"/> to tell me, <hi>That as Gentry bought nothing at Market, ſo Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paid no Debts, but thoſe of the Penal Laws; and that he did verily believe, the fraudulent Contracts of moſt Creditors begot the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability of their Debtors ſatisfaction.</hi> I ſhall refer to your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences the reſpective cauſe of your ſeveral reſtraints: Mine own is like that of the adventurous Merchant, who having ſent all his own Stock in ſeveral Veſſels to far diſtant Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries through the various dangers of the Deep, is conſtrained to take upon Truſt at home, till the return of his Cargazoons, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſucceſs, proclaim him happy, or bankrupt; and if I had ever any other deſign in borrowing, let my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer exclude me from the general pardon of his precious merits, who came not to call the juſt, but ſinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, aſſuring us, that the bleſſed Angels rejoice more at the converſion of one true Penitent, than the integrity of ninety nine righteous; from whence we may conclude, 'tis ninety nine to one odds, that there are very few ſincere Converts.</p>
               <p>But my beloved Fellow-ſufferers, ſince now the Supreme Power of this Common-wealth doth, as I hear, intend, like S. <hi>Peters</hi> good Angel, to open the doors of your Priſons by the wiſdom of their mercies, I earneſtly exhort you to mark the firſt day of your unexpected Jubile with a white ſtone or red letter, in commemoration of ſo happy a deliverance, (leſt God conſume your lives with new afflictions and troubles) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes remembring his glory and your eternity: And then take the grave admonition for your Cure, as the Mirror of my honoured Maſter preſcribed to me, which was, <hi>To deny all my treacherous Senſes their most delighting Objects;</hi> I fed on nothing that pleaſed my appetite, looking willingly on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which I formerly liked, nor accompanied any creature that affected my concupiſcence, But frequented devious wayes and ſolitary groves, and at laſt found out a deſolate Iſland in the Iriſh ſeas, where three years I ſadly lamented the errours of my youth, mingling the waters which I drank with the brine of mine eyes, and did ſparingly eat the bread of affliction as it had been aſhes.

But there the inhumanity of my Creditors ſtopt me; yet I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, ſo ſoon as the Republique affairs will permit, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Parliament will enlarge me in order to my Mineral ſervice, and their own Articles, as they have done you in mercy: And then I ſay, if any of you (either for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſubſiſtence, or a penitential way to expiate your former errours, or to reclaim your affections, or in hope to raiſe your loſt fortunes and enable you to pay your honeſt Debts) will ſweat with me in the way of this hopeful, vertuous and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical labour, you ſhall eat bread with me ſo long as you pleaſe, whereby at laſt we may obtain ſuch Mineral bleſſings from the Lord of Bounty, that we in true charity may be able to caſt our bread upon the waters, by relieving many diſtreſſed Penitents whoſe ſins have brought them to want bread, and whoſe age or ſickneſs hath taken away their ability to work.</p>
               <p>And here I think 'tis proper to give you the Epitome of my Lords Deſign for the regulating his <hi>Solomons Houſe</hi> or <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy.

But theſe dead here (to whoſe lives the Law and Opinion hath ſet a period) by ſearching the graves of Minerals, preſerve their lives for the preſent, and in time find their own Reſurrection, by a temporal Expiation of their fatal Crimes, though their other hopes prove fruſtrate: but if the Almighty crowns their labors, obſerve how glorious it will prove! the Prince or State that ſhall then Rule, ſhall receive the firſt fruits; thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of poor Subjects ſhall eat the bread of comfort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; Offenders ſhall be purged and freed; Trade ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and Cuſtoms augmented; a matchleſſe Academy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and maintained; new Arts diſcovered for the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal good, and honor of the Nation; the honorable Truſtees of the whole work ſhall merit glory, and gain Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal recreations; the experimenting Philoſophers ſhall have a competent and comfortable ſubſiſtence during life, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their change their reſpective Statues erected in the City of <hi>Wells;</hi> And as the <hi>Athenians</hi> when they dedicated a lively I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the memory of the antient Philoſopher <hi>Pherecides,</hi> gave it a golden tongue, as a proper Emblem of his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent eloquence, ſo each of theirs ſhall hold a ſignificant Character of their peculiar Inventions in their well-propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd hands.

               <p>Now concerning the validity and grandure of this Myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Attempt, you are to underſtand, that the College of our moſt honoured Phyſicians, which is the Philoſophical

               <p>In a word, howſoever you value my Invitation to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate in my Mineral profeſſion, neglect not my cordial Counſel in matters of Devotion and ſincere Penitence: For 'tis conceived by ſome truly religious and very learned, that the Penitent only ſhall recruit the Regiments and glorious Hoſt of the intellectual Angels, by ſupplying the place of them that fell with <hi>Lucifer</hi> in his great Rebellion.

               <p>
                  <hi>CHriſtopher Wright,</hi> aged fifty ſix years, maketh Oath, That he was ſent by Mr. <hi>Joſeph Hexeter</hi> of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> to be in the ſame place of Steward for direction of Mr. <hi>Buſhels</hi> Minerals under ground, as the ſaid Mr. <hi>Hexeter</hi> was under him in <hi>Wales</hi> at 100 l. <hi>per an.</hi> ſalary: And finding the ſaid Mr. <hi>Buſhell</hi> to give ſuch probable reaſons for recovering the inundation of water out of the vaſt and drowned Works of <hi>Rowpits,</hi> by perſuing a Drift as a Common-ſhore, from the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42606:26"/> Concaves of a natural Swallow twenty fathom deep, after his induſtry had ſunk twenty ſhafts to diſcover the ſame, on purpoſe to come to the rich Loads of metal known to be buried in the adjacent Groves of water, This Deponent and others, upon confidence of making good his great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings therein (although his judgement was then much queſtioned by the Inhabitants for the attempt) did and do deſire but half wages ever ſince the Miners of <hi>Mendip</hi> had invited the ſaid Mr. <hi>Buſhell</hi> under their hands and Decree of their Court, to have half the profit, bearing half the charge, after the water was drained, which this Deponent doth veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe will be in a ſhort time perfected, and appear for precedent ſake, as well as for preſent profit, the greateſt work that hath been done by any Mineraliſts theſe hundred years, if the malitious attempts of ſome ill-natured perſons do not now hinder the growth of his proceedings therein: For this Deponent doth depoſe, That by ſome wicked perſons there was a great Lake of muddy water turned about the hour of midnight, and upon a great flood, into the Swallow, on purpoſe as is conceived to choak it, and ſo conſequently to drown his men that came from forein parts, and were then working twenty fathom deep, which this Deponent doth aver were forced to ſave their lives by running up their Groves at the ſame time, the Swallow being not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the torrent of its water. And this Deponent doth likewiſe depoſe, That about the 10. of <hi>October</hi> laſt there was ſome other ſuch envious perſons, who pulled down ſo much of the under-timber of his Shaft, that the whole Grove of earth fell into Mr. <hi>Buſhels</hi> Drift, when his men were at work underneath; and it was ſuppoſed by divers never to be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: But thanks be to God, the danger is paſt, and Mr. <hi>Buſhels</hi> Drift goeth on towards the rich Works known to lie 150 fathom before him; for this Deponent was one of the workmen that landed 100 l. <hi>per</hi> week out of one Shaft this laſt ſummer, and ſaw 200 l. <hi>per</hi> week out of another; but the charge of drawing water, though in the drought of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42606:26"/> ſummer, ſtood (as they reported) in 80 l. <hi>per</hi> week a piece, which Mr. <hi>Buſhels</hi> Drift will prevent; and likewiſe to 1000 more of the like nature as are ſuppoſed to be within the verge of <hi>Rowpits.</hi>

               <p>WHereas we of the Mineral Grand Jury finding by a decretal Order of our Predeceſſors, <hi>May</hi> 28. and their Letter <hi>May</hi> 2. in anſwer of <hi>Tho: Buſhell</hi>'s Eſq; to incourage him to go on in his adventures for recovering the drowned works of <hi>Rowpits,</hi> which were formerly the deſerted works of Sir <hi>Bevis Bulmar</hi> in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign; And whereas many of the chief Adventurers in the ſaid <hi>Rowpits,</hi> do and have conſented to ſurrender not only the one half of their works and Mines there, but likewiſe the pre-emption of the other half, paying as much as any other Merchant will give, unto the ſaid <hi>Tho: Buſhell</hi> and his Aſſigns, when the ſaid <hi>Tho: Buſhell</hi> doth make it appear unto the Mineral Court for the time being, that by his and their workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip they be freed from the inundation of their waters; We of the Grand Jury do Order and confirm the ſaid Decree. And whereas we find the ſaid <hi>Tho. Buſhell</hi> hath (in relation to his undertakings of recovering their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) brought it ſo near a probability of perfection, that in time all perſons of known Judgement cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the ſame will be done for the general good of thoſe that had formerly ſuffered by thoſe Grooves, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a preſident for others to follow the like example, as alſo the certainty of knowing the vaſt riches that lie in <hi>Rowpits</hi> and <hi>Green Oar:</hi> And whereas we are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the ſaid <hi>Tho.

Buſhell</hi> in ſome of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Mines-Royal, and Edifices appertaining to the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al-works, and have plucked up divers plumps caſt in the Rubbiſh, drowned, and (ſo much as in them did lye) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the ſaid work, ſo as it hath been a labour of four years night and day to recover the ſame. And that alſo the ſaid <hi>Tho. Buſhell</hi> hath been diſturbed in the getting of Turf and Peat for the ſervice of his Majeſties works, being an invention of his own, very commendable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for the preſerving of Wood, which hath been heretofore by the former Undertakers much waſted in thoſe parts. Now for the remedy of the ſaid Miſchiefs, and that the ſaid <hi>Tho. Buſhell</hi> and his Aſſigns, and ſuch perſons as are or ſhall be Undertakers and Adventurers with him in the ſaid ſervice may receive all due incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb facs="tcp:42606:35"/> and aſſiſtance in thoſe chargeable undertakings; It is ordered by the Lords in the Upper Houſe of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> now aſſembled, That the Speaker of this Houſe, in the Name, and by the Authority of the ſame, ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect His Letters unto the Iudges of Aſſize, and Iuſtices of the Peace of the ſaid County of <hi>Cardigan:</hi> Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, that they do in all lawfull things endeavour to advance, and encourage the ſaid ſervice in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Royal Mines, and aſſiſt the ſaid <hi>Tho. Buſhell</hi> and other Undertakers, in all things ſo far as lawfully they may, both for the continuance of his lawfull Poſſeſſions, and and the quiet and peaceable working of the ſaid Mines, untill he ſhall be evicted by due courſe of Law, as alſo for getting and working of Turf and Peat, according to his Legal right upon his Majeſties Waſtes, and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces lawfull, and all other lawfull accommodations of neceſſary paſſages, and other Legal things, which may any waies advance His Majeſties ſervice in the ſaid Royal Mines.</p>

               <p>MOſt glorious and omniſcient Lord God, who inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteſt Eternity, and by thy omnipotent <hi>fiat</hi> didſt in the beginning create the admirable fabrick of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; the Heavens are thy Throne, and the Earth is thy Foot-ſtool, on which thou didſt frame our firſt Parent of red Clay, and from thence gaveſt him his name, into whoſe Noſtrils thou didſt breath the Spirit of Life, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing him with a reaſonable Soul, and madeſt him Lord of all thy Creatures; But he being in honour could not abide ſo, but became like the Beaſt that periſheth, through the treachery of that firſt Rebel Satan, who ever ſince endeavoureth to ſupplant his wretched poſterity, of whom my ſinfull ſelf am one. Give me therefore (O Lord) a true ſenſe of mine own ſins without deſpair, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere contrition, unfeigned ſorrow and earneſt repentance without hypocriſie; make my Prayers fervent, holy and gratefull, that they may come before thee as the incenſe of a true penitent ſoul; for a broken and contrite heart, is a ſacrifice which thou wilt not deſpiſe: And now, O God, having firſt ſought thy mercy on my ſoul, give me leave to implore thy bleſſing on my temporal affairs to thy ſole glory. O Lord, thy Spirit hath affected mine with the ſpeculation and practice of Mineral Philoſophy, and thou wert pleaſed to bleſſe that moſt Royal and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Philoſopher, who underſtood and writ of the natures
<pb facs="tcp:42606:36"/> of all vegetables, from the <hi>Cedar</hi> of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> to the pelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory or moſſe on the wall, as plainly appeared by the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of his Miners tranſported by <hi>Hyram</hi>'s Mariners to <hi>Opher,</hi> whence they returned with 450. Talents of Gold, for effecting whereof that King built and rigged a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Navy at <hi>Ezron Gebar</hi> on the red Sea, with a vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his own or peoples treaſure; But (O Lord) my modeſt deſign requires no ſuch charge or means, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of that great modern Philoſopher, my worthy honored Lord, are to diſcover thoſe hidden Treaſures, which thy inſcrutable wiſdom hath lodged in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the moſt barren Mountains, and deſperately deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Mineral works of our native Countries. It is true (Lord) they that deſcend to the Sea in ſhips, ſee they wonders in the depth thereof; but ſuch as ſearch the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Entrails of the Earth, to find out thy concealed won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders there, carry their lives in their hands, being free a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the dead, whence they pray unto thee, and praiſe thy marvellous works of nature, when men ride over their heads. But (O Lord) the inſatiate thirſt of riches or vain glory ſpurs not me on to this dangerous and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious attempt, but my zeal to thy glory, and my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries good. <hi>Solomon</hi> beautified thine own Temple which he had built with his far ſought Mineral Treaſure, and I would therefore willingly erect a houſe to the honour of his name; in which fabrick (deſigned by my honored Maſter) true Chriſtian Philoſophers, of eminent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, virtuous lives, and holy converſations, might by practical ſearch and diſcoveries reveal to ſucceeding ages theſe beneficent rarities, and profitable experiments which that great King firſt treated of, being loſt (as is conceived) to all mankind through thy ſeveral Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thrown in thine own back ſliding people, till that Lord (my quondam Maſter) aſſiſted by thy Spirit of
<pb facs="tcp:42606:36"/> wiſdom, did in his natural Hiſtory, and that moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent model in his <hi>New Atlantis</hi> propoſe to the world a new means to make uſe of them, to thy glory, and the benefit of all thy ſervants, without any conſiderable charge to this or any other State. But (O Lord) the blindneſſe, ſtupidity and diffidence of mans heart hath as yet obſtructed the procedure thereof. <hi>Dives</hi> deſired no other means than a Meſſenger from Hell for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of his Brethren which he had miſled; now the living which converſe with the ſubterranean ſpirits can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be believed in reporting thy wonders in the boſome of the Earth. The <hi>Ninevites</hi> were converted when thy fugitive Prophet brought them a penitential Sermon out of the belly of the Whale; grant (O my God) that I which am at preſent buried alive, and ſecluded from the World may be thence heard by thee, and ſo credited by the preſent ruling Power, that I thy humble ſuppliant (who like the poor bedridden men at the Pool of <hi>Betheſda</hi> have lain long impotent and unable to move) may find ſome faithfull Patriots to aſſiſt my cauſe, and make them ſenſible that I beg nothing but that which is loſt, and the help of the dead only to recover it. The Mines that I Petition for are drowned, and their works deſperately deſerted; the perſons I propoſe for their recovery, are ſuch as are dead in Law, and crave as a mercy to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in them, by a patient undergoing their puniſhment as pioneers, and turning their neceſſities into ſuch virtuous actions, rather than a forc'd baniſhment ſhould expoſe them to a ſeven years ſlavery in forein plantations. Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds beſt cut Diamonds, the ſtony-hearted are fitteſt to cut the ſtony Addits of the Mines, and like to like will agree beſt, when a penitential Soul ſtrikes the blow. For (O Lord) we all know, the Prodigal Child was puniſht with its oppoſite; and believe all others have congruity
<pb facs="tcp:42606:37"/> in the like, when thy only Son was forc'd for taking upon him the ſins of man, to deſcend himſelf into Hell, before he could aſcend into Heaven; and who knows (O Lord) but that this Mineral imployment is the beſt way found out for us Mortals, to diſcipline all offenders capable of mercy, with diſcovering thy concealed Treaſures, and make ſuch thy only creatures, when the perſon which thou placeſt over them by thy Miniſters of State, ſhall take delightfull care in their education and amendment, to thy own glory and the publick good, fince thou joyeſt more in one of them, than in 99. righteous, that need no repentance. O Lord, in theſe deſigns I earneſtly beg thy aſſiſtance, ſince thy Son our Saviour hath bid us to ask, ſeek and knock, that we may obtain, find and be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; pardon then my confidence, diligence and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity: I have now ſpent many Luſtres of my life, and ſome Treaſure in proſecution of this defign; O let me effect it ſo to thy glory before I go hence, as my Feoffees in truſt may not be diſcouraged to go on where I have left; for time makes haſt, to call for natures debt, and Death is none of thy Creature. Let not then my worſt Creditor be only ſatisfied, before thou haſt aſſiſted me in ſome meaſure to pay the Debt of Zeal and Obedience which I owe to thee, that of Love and Service due to my native County, the real ſums due to confiding friends, and the great Debt of gratitude to the memory of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Maſter, Foſter-Father and Inſtructor in theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings. Pardon then my ſins, and grant this my Boone, ſince mercy and bounty are the moſt eſſential At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of thy Glory; to whom all Honour, Obedience, Praiſe and Thankſgiving is now and ever due, Amen.</p>

               <p>The end of our <hi>Foundation</hi> is the knowledge of <hi>Cauſes,</hi> and ſecret mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of things: and the Enlarging of the bounds of <hi>Humane Empire,</hi> to the effecting of all things poſſible.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Preparations</hi> and <hi>Inſtruments are theſe.</hi> We have large and deep <hi>Caves</hi> of ſeveral Depths: The deepeſt are ſunk 600 Fathome: And ſome of them are digged and made under great Hills and Mountains: So that if you reckon together the Depth of the Hill, and the Depth of the Cave, they are (ſome of them) above three miles deep. For we find, that the depth of an Hill, and the depth of a Cave from the Flat, is the ſame thing; both remote alike from the Sun, and Heavens Beams, and from the open Air. Theſe <hi>Caves we call the Lower Region.</hi> And we uſe them for all <hi>Coagulations, Indurations, Refrigerations, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of Bodies.</hi> We uſe them likewiſe for the <hi>Imitation of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Mines; And the producing alſo of new Artificial Metals, by Compoſitions</hi> and <hi>Materials</hi> which we uſe and lay there for many years. We uſe them alſo ſometimes, (which may ſeem ſtrange) for <hi>Curing</hi> of ſome <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> and for <hi>Prolongation</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> in ſome <hi>Hermits</hi> that chooſe to live there, well accommodated of all things neceſſary, and indeed live very long, by whom alſo we learn many things.</p>
               <p>We have <hi>Burials</hi> in ſeveral <hi>Earths,</hi> where we put divers <hi>Cements,</hi> as the <hi>Chineſes</hi> do their <hi>Porcellane.</hi> But we have them in greater Variety, and ſome of them more fine. We alſo have great variety of <hi>Compoſts,</hi> and <hi>Soils,</hi> for the making of the Earth fruitfull.</p>
               <p>We have high <hi>Towers,</hi> The higheſt about half a Mile in height; And ſome of them likewiſe ſet upon high <hi>Mountains:</hi> So that the vantage of the Hill with the <hi>Tower,</hi> is in the higheſt of them three Miles at leaſt. And theſe places we call the <hi>Upper Region;</hi> Accounting the Air between the <hi>High places,</hi> and the <hi>Low,</hi> as a <hi>Middle Region.</hi> We uſe theſe <hi>Towers,</hi> according to their ſeveral Heights and Situations, for <hi>Inſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42606:38"/> Refrigeration, Converſion;</hi> And for the <hi>View</hi> of divers <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors;</hi> as <hi>Wind, Rain, Snow, Hail;</hi> And ſome of the <hi>Fiery Meteors</hi> alſo. And upon them, in ſome places, are dwellings of <hi>Hermits,</hi> whom we viſit ſometimes, and inſtruct what to obſerve.</p>
               <p>We have great <hi>Lakes,</hi> both <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Freſh,</hi> whereof we have uſe for the <hi>Fiſh,</hi> and <hi>Fowl.</hi> We uſe them alſo for <hi>Burials</hi> of ſome <hi>Natural Bodies:</hi> For we find a difference in things buried in <hi>Earth,</hi> or in <hi>Air</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Earth,</hi> and things buried in Water.

               </p>
               <p>We have alſo great and ſpacious <hi>Houſes,</hi> where we imitate and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate <hi>Meteors;</hi> as <hi>Snow, Hail, Rain,</hi> ſome <hi>Artificial Rains of Bodies,</hi> and not of <hi>Water, Thunder, Lightnings;</hi> Alſo <hi>Generations</hi> of <hi>Bodies</hi> in <hi>Air;</hi> as <hi>Froggs, Flies,</hi> and divers others.</p>
               <p>We have alſo certain <hi>Chambers,</hi> which we call <hi>Chambers of Health,</hi> where we qualifie the <hi>Air</hi> as we think good, and proper for the cure of di-<hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> and <hi>preſervation of Health.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have alſo fair and large <hi>Baths,</hi> of ſeveral mixtures, for the <hi>Cure</hi> of <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> and the reſtoring of <hi>Mans Body</hi> from <hi>Arefaction:</hi> and other for the <hi>Confirming</hi> of it in <hi>Strength</hi> of <hi>Sinews, vital parts;</hi> and the very <hi>Juice</hi> and <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the <hi>Body.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>We have alſo means to make divers <hi>Plants</hi> riſe by <hi>Mixtures</hi> of <hi>Earth</hi> without <hi>Seeds;</hi> And likewiſe to make divers New <hi>Plants,</hi> differing from the vulgar, and to make one <hi>Tree</hi> or <hi>Plant</hi> turn into another.</p>
               <p>We have alſo <hi>Parks,</hi> and <hi>Encloſures</hi> of all ſorts of <hi>Beaſts</hi> and <hi>Birds,</hi> which we uſe not only for view or Rareneſs, but likewiſe for <hi>Diſſections</hi> and <hi>Tryals;</hi> That thereby we may take light, what may be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Man.</hi> Wherein we find many ſtrange Effects. as <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing Life</hi> in them, though divers <hi>Parts,</hi> which you account <hi>Vital,</hi> be periſhed, and taken forth, <hi>Reſuſcitating</hi> of ſome that ſeem <hi>Dead</hi> in <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,</hi> and the like. We try alſo all <hi>Poyſons,</hi> and other <hi>Medicines</hi> upon them, as well of <hi>Chirurgery</hi> as <hi>Phyſick.</hi> By Art likewiſe we make them <hi>Greater</hi> or <hi>Taller</hi> than their kind is; And contrary wiſe <hi>Drawf</hi> them and ſtay their <hi>Growth:</hi> We make them more <hi>Fruitful</hi> and <hi>Bearing</hi> than their kind is; And contrarywiſe <hi>Barren</hi> and not <hi>Generative.</hi> Alſo we make them differ in <hi>Colour, Shape,</hi> and <hi>Activity</hi> many wayes. We find means to make <hi>Commixtures</hi> and <hi>Copulations</hi> of divers <hi>Kinds,</hi> which have produced many <hi>New Kinds,</hi> and them not <hi>Barren,</hi> as the general opinion is. We make a number of <hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>Serpents, Worms, Flies, Fiſhes,</hi> of <hi>Putrefaction,</hi> whereof ſome are advanced (in effect) to be <hi>Perfect Creatures,</hi> like <hi>Beaſts,</hi> or <hi>Birds;</hi> And have <hi>Sexes,</hi> and do propagate. Neither do we this by <hi>Chance,</hi> but we know before hand, of what <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Commixture,</hi> what <hi>Kind</hi> of thoſe <hi>Creatures</hi> will ariſe.</p>
               <p>We have alſo <hi>Particular Pools,</hi> where we make <hi>Tryals</hi> upon <hi>Fiſhes,</hi> as we have ſaid before of <hi>Beaſts</hi> and <hi>Birds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have alſo <hi>Places</hi> for <hi>Breed</hi> and <hi>Generation</hi> of thoſe <hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>Worms,</hi> and <hi>Flies,</hi> which are of <hi>Special Uſe;</hi> ſuch as are with you your <hi>Silk-worms</hi> and <hi>Bees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not hold you long with recounting of our <hi>Brew-houſes, Bake-houſes,</hi> and <hi>Kitchins,</hi> where are made divers <hi>Drinks, Bread,</hi> and <hi>Meats,</hi> rare and of eſpecial effects. <hi>Wines</hi> we have of <hi>Grapes;</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> of other <hi>Juyce,</hi> of <hi>Fruits,</hi> of <hi>Grains,</hi> and of <hi>Roots,</hi> and of <hi>Mixtures</hi> with <hi>Honey, Sugar, Manna;</hi> and <hi>Fruits dried</hi> and <hi>decocted:</hi> Alſo of the <hi>Tears</hi> or <hi>Woundings</hi> of <hi>Trees;</hi> And of the <hi>Pulp</hi> of <hi>Canes.</hi> And theſe <hi>Drinks</hi> are of ſeveral <hi>Ages,</hi> ſome to the <hi>Age</hi> or Laſt of forty years. We have <hi>Drinks</hi> alſo brewed with ſeveral <hi>Herbs,</hi> and <hi>Roots,</hi> and <hi>Spices;</hi> Yea with ſeveral <hi>Fleſhes,</hi> and <hi>White-Meats;</hi> whereof ſome of the <hi>Drinks</hi> are ſuch as they are in effect <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> both: So

But the ſudden change of his Royal Miſtreſſes countenance, acting ſo Tragical a part upon his only friend, and her once deareſt Favourite, he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe yielded his Law-ſtudies as loſt, deſpairing of any preferment from the preſent State, as by many of his Letters in his Book of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains appears, ſo that he retired to his Philoſophy for ſome few months, from whence he preſented the then riſing Sun (Prince <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>) with an experiment of his ſecond Collections, to know the heart of Man by a ſympathizing ſtone, made of ſeveral mixtures, and uſher'd in the conceit with this enſuing diſcourſe: <hi>Moſt Royal Sir, Since you are by birth the Prince of our Country, and your vertues the happy pledge to our poſterity; and that the ſeigniory of Greatneſſe is ever attended more with flatterers, than faithfull Friends, and loyal Subjects; and therefore needeth more helps to diſcern and prie into the hearts of the People, than private perſons. Give me leave noble Sir, as ſmall Rivulets run to the vaſt Ocean to pay their tribute; ſo let me have the honour to ſhew your Highneſſe the Operative quality of theſe two triangular ſtones (as the firſt fruits of my Philoſophy) to imitate the pathetical motion of the Load-ſtone and Iron, although made up by the Compounds of Meteors, (as Star-ſhot jelly and other like magical ingredients, with the reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beams of the Sun, on purpoſe, that the warmth diſtilled unto them through the moiſt heat of the hand, might diſcover the affection of the heart, by a viſ ble ſign of their attraction and appetite to each other, like the hand of a Watch, within ten minutes after they are laid upon a marble

But then finding another deſolate Cell of Natures rarities at the head of a Spring near my own Houſe in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> which my Conſcience gave me was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted by Providence to retard my intended travels, I (in imitation of that excellent Lords ſublime fancy) beautyfied the ſame with the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of contemplative Groves &amp; Walks, as well as artificial Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Lightning, Rain, Hail-ſhowers, Drums beating, Organs playing, Birds ſinging, Waters murmuring, the Dead ariſing, Lights moving, Rainbows reflecting with the beams of the Sun, and watry ſhowers ſpringing from the ſame Fountain; theſe were then my ſole Companions, and ſpeechleſs Preachers to inform me without
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42606:45"/> truſting to the broken ſtaff of faithleſſe men. And to free my ſelf from the trouble of any Cook, I obſerved my Lords preſcription, to ſatisfie nature with a Diet of Oyl, Hony, Muſtard, Herbs and Bisket, my Drink Water, like thoſe long-lif'd Fathers before the Food; where the late King finding me in this poſture, and by my then diſcourſe in commemoration of my old Maſter, conceived me capable (with the help of that Lords Philoſophy) to do him ſome more acceptable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in Mineral diſcoveries (for the Honour of the Nation) than the collation I made him of his own native ſilver, upon his ſecond viſiting that Rock the year following.</p>
            <p>But let me tell you, before theſe Philoſophical trials of natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes could be brought to any perfection, I with patience endured all reproaches of malitious mindes, and woar the fools coat in the repute of men more ready to condemn, than examine; yet had not Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutes aroſe upon my ſucceſſes in Mineral diſcoveries, and the late Warrs interven'd, with the commands of the King to attend his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein, (which occaſioned my proceedings for ſixteen years to be loſt) I preſume, providence (without any partner) had ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me to give incredulous perſons a plenary ſatisfaction of that Lords unparalleld abilities, the meer fame of whoſe unlimited bounty and nobleneſſe of mind, did ſo much incline my affections to ſerve him, at the firſt ſight, as I was never ſatisfied till (by my own addreſſe, without interceſſion of others) he admitted me his ſervant, that ſo I might (from my own experience) give account of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, when I travelled into forein parts.
